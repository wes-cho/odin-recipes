        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Sikhye (rice punch) is a traditional sweet Korean drink made of fermented malt and rice. As 
            the rice ferments, the grains turn white and become spongy, releasing their starch into the 
            liquid, which turns light amber. The punch is never fermented long enough to become alcoholic, 
            and it is often served as a dessert in Korean restaurants. It has a pleasantly malty \\
            aftertaste.</p>

        <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
            <li>18 Cups Cold Water</li>
            <li>8 oz Barley Malt Powder</li>
            <li>1 cup Rice</li>
            <li>1 Cup Sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <ol><strong>Steps</strong>
            <li>Combine barley malt powder and 14 cups cold water in a large bowl. Stir well.</li>
            <li>Let sit for 2-3 hours until the powder settles at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Make rice using rice cooker</li>
            <li>When rice is done, add the clear malt water from bowl gently into the rice cooker.</li>
            <li>Stir rice with wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Set rice cooker to warm and let ferment.</li>
            <li> Stir rest of the 4 cups of water int o the leftover barley malt sediment. Leave it 
                to sit and settle while the rice ferments in the rice cooker.</li>
            <li>Open rice cooker after 4 hours and check to see if some rice grains are floating.</li>
            <li>About a dozen grains should be floating. If not floating yet, let it ferment for
                another hour.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot sikhye out of the rice cooker into a large pot.</li>
            <li>Gently pour the clear malt water that has been separating while the sikhye ferments and
                discard the sediment. You will get about 3 cups of clear malty water.</li>
            <li> Cover the pot and bring to a boil for 10 minutes. Add 1 cup sugar.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot sikhye through a strainer over a large bowl to gather all the rice. Rinse
                rice under cold running water and transfer to an airtight container with cold water.
                Cover and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Cool the hot sikhye water and transfer to a glass jar. Refrigerate.</li>
            <li>When you want to serve, ladle about 1.5 cup cold sikhye water to a small bowl and 
                gently stir in about 2 tablespoons rice.</li>
        </ol>
