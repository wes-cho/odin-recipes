        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Kimchi bokkeumbap is a simple South Korean dish made with a combination of fried rice and 
            kimchi. It is considered to be a great way to use leftover kimchi. The dish can also be 
            enriched with additional ingredients such as meat, vegetables, and soy sauce.</p>

        <p>In most cases, kimchi bokkeumbap is topped with a fried egg before serving, although it 
            can also be garnished with sesame seeds, finely chopped green onions, or gim. Because 
            it is very easy to prepare, inexpensive, and comforting, the dish is a favorite amongst 
            South Korean students.</p>
